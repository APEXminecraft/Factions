#  FeatherBoard 3
#  Runs like a feather on your server
#  (c) Maxim Van de Wynckel
#
# ------------------------------ #

# Permissions: To use the action groups give them the permission
#              featherboard.group.<group>
#              Make sure to remove them from the other groups
#              when giving a new permission.

# Variables: These variables can be used in the TEXT section
#            of both the header as the footer.
#            
#            {PLAYER}       - Player name
#            {PLAYERNICK}   - Player nickname
#            {SERVER}       - Server name
#            {PLAYERCOUNT}  - Server player count
#            {BUNGEECOUNT}  - Bungee network player count
#            4000+ more ... see spigot page

# Formatting: These are formatting tags allowing you to format the animations
#             or placeholders.
#
#             Substring: This allows you to split a word (even a placeholder) in parts
#               example: <substring begin=0 end=3>Hello World</substring> = Hel
#               usage: This can be used to split placeholders when creating a typewriter
#                      or to split the colors in a placeholder.
#
#             Scroll: This creates a scrolling animation of the text inside it. It accepts
#                     two arguments (the length and space between scrolls).
#               example: <scroll width=20 spaces=20>&2This is a &atest</scroll>

boards:
  # Default FeatherBoard comes with a board called "default". All players have the permission
  # featherboard.group.default  (by default) meaning all players should see the scoreboard unless
  # the permission is negated.
  #
  # You can create as many boards as you want as long as the name is unique. It is advised to give logical
  # names such as "vip-board", "mcmmo-levelup", ...
  default:
    # Every section here are different lines. The first section will be used as the title
    # the following sections will be used as the lines on the scoreboard (max 15)
    # Just as the scoreboard names you can name these 'lines' whatever you want. But to make
    # things simple I will use logical names such as "title", "spacer", "header", ...
    title:
      # Every line has its own frames. The animation will loop through these frames on intervals
      # that you configure below.
      # Put all your frames under 'text:'. You can make as many lines as you want and use
      # placeholders and preset effects.
